            <p>
                In this experiment I explored the passport authorization. Authorization is the process of giving someone permission to do or have something. In multi-user computer systems, a system administrator defines for the system which users are allowed access to the system and what privileges of use (such as access to which file directories, hours of access, amount of allocated storage space, and so forth). Assuming that someone has logged in to a computer operating system or application, the system or application may want to identify what resources the user can be given during this session. Thus, authorization is sometimes seen as both the preliminary setting up of permissions by a system administrator and the actual checking of the permission values that have been set up when a user is getting access.

            <h2>Project Link:</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="http://easynotes-shakti200.rhcloud.com/">Go to my project page and click login. </a>  <br />
                Go the project link and register yourself. A record will be created for you in the database and you can sign in using your credentials to view the profile page.
            </p>

            <h3>Profile Authorize</h3>
            <p>
                I have exposed the <code>/profile</code> service as a get request. So anyone can access the profile page 
                by requesting the service from browser. Now the aim of the project is to make the profile page available to only logged in users.
                This is achieved by the <code>auth</code> service of passport to check authentication.
                I have exposed the <code>loggedin</code> service to check if the user is actually logged in or not. 
            </p>

            <h3>Node JS Code Snippet:</h3>
            
            <p>The auth method checks if the request is authenticated or not. That is, if the user is already logged or not.</p>
            <pre class="code">var auth = function(req, res, next)
{
    if (!req.isAuthenticated())
        res.send(401);
    else
        next();
};

app.get('/loggedin', function(req, res){
    res.send(req.isAuthenticated() ? req.user : '0');
});
</pre>


            <h3>AngularJS Code Snippet</h3>
            <p>In the client side , on the route of <code>/profile</code> I added a resolve.This makes the route to profile page only if the 
            resolve function returns a resolved status. Otherwise I have added an alert saying the user to login.</p>
            <pre class="code">  when('/profile', {
            templateUrl: 'profile.html',
            resolve: {
                loggedin: checkLoggedin
            }
        }).

                var checkLoggedin = function($q, $timeout, $http, $location, $rootScope)
{
    var deferred = $q.defer();
    $http.get('/loggedin').success(function(user)
    {
        $rootScope.errorMessage = null;
        // User is Authenticated
        if (user !== '0')
        {
            $rootScope.currentUser = user;
            deferred.resolve();
        }
        // User is Not Authenticated
        else
        {
            $rootScope.errorMessage = 'You need to log in.';
            alert("You need to login");
            deferred.reject();
            $location.url('/login');
        }
    });
    
    return deferred.promise;
};

</pre>
            <p>When the user tries to access the profile page without logging in, he gets an alert asking him to login.</p>
