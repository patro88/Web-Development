        <h1>Data Storage - MongoDB</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            A lot of data is handled in the project, for backend storage purpose I am using MongoDB which is a no SQL database.
            In mongoDB there are collections instead of tables and documents (JSON Objects) instead of tupples.
            <br>
            The Coolections for my project are :
        </p>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Collection</b></td>

                    <td><b>Purpose</b></td>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>user</td>
                    <td>This is the collection which stores data about the user i.e. the data to that user enters at time of registration. Also it stores the array of pages , which contains all the widgets created by the user.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>question</td>
                    <td>The puspose of this collection is to store all the questions in the database. It has other important properties like answers array, likes array, created by , and tags array.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>tag</td>
                    <td>This collection is used to store all the tags created while creating a question. The Question and tags collections have a many to many relation.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
