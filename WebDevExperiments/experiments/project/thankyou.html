            This is the end of Web Development Course.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the course I learned many cutting edge technologies like jQuery, JavaScript, AngularJS and most important NodeJS and MongoDB.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would definitely like to thank Prof. Jose Annunziato for teaching me these technolgies and increasing my skill set to a great extent. I would also like to thank Prof. Richard Rasala for
            this wonderful course. From the beginning I had referred Prof. Jose's and Prof. Rasala's website for help and guidance.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would also like to thank my TA Sneha Vankireddy for solving my queries and weekly reviewing my work.
            <br>
            <br>
            Beside this, other resources used in learning were Google, MSDN, StackOverflow, W3 Schools.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am happy to put a good looking website on server and hope everybody likes it.
            <br>
