        <h2> Project : Scribal Utility </h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            In this project I have developed a content management system - Scribal Utility.
            I designed this application keeping in mind the problems faced by me during the courses in the university.
            This application helps to organize classnotes, bookmarks , pictures and vidoes taken during reading hours by a student
            and keep them for a later reference.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another usage of the application involves asking doubts , answering the questions and looking up the questions in the repository.
            This part was developed keeping in mind all the questions the students can get and getting their solutions from other students and professors.
        </p>
