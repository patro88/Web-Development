<h3>Week 3 Blog entry</h3>

<p>
    This week I worked on <strong>Jquery and Jquery UI</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    First, I learned to write events, animations using basic javascript and Jquery.  <br />

    After this when I got a hang of jquery, I started modifying DOM elements like adding , removing elements dynamically and also adding contents into the existing elements.

    Then I learnedd an important feature , AJAx with Jquery. In this experiment I just tried to load a file from server and handle exceptions.

    <br />
    After learning  Jquery, I tried to do some animations, interactions and effects using Jquery UI. This API has many functions which we can use directly in our websites.
    Jquery UI <a href="../experiments/week03/week304.htm" target="_blank"> Interactions </a> and 
    <a href="../experiments/week03/week305.htm" target="_blank"> Effects </a><br />
