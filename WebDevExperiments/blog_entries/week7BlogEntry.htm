<h3>Week 7 Blog entry</h3>

<p>
    This week I worked on Mongo DB.
    I learnt CRUD operations and did experiment on each of these operations. I also implemented previous knowledge of 
    Angular JS and NodeJS into this week's experiments.

<p>
    I began with the configurations and installing of mongo on openshift and use of RockMongo.
    Previous to installing on openshift, I installed on local machines and worked my experiments on localhost server. 
    After completing them successfully on local, I extended them onto openshift which was very easy. <br />
