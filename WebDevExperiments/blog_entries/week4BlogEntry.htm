<h3>Week 4 Blog entry</h3>

<p>
    This week I worked completely on <strong>Angular JS</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    I started off with basic binding in angular JS. In the first experiment I show how first name and last names are bound to an input box.
    I learned basic angular directives and expressions.  <br />

    The second experiment was just an extension of the first. In this, I tried to implement calculations on the scope parameters.

    The next two experiments are based on movie list as explained in the class. As the class experiments were very challenging, I tried to replicate them in my system.

    For the last experiment, I tried to do some new experiments I learnt while reading about angular Js in different sites.
    I tried one-time binding, and filtering.
