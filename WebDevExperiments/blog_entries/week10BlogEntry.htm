<h3>Week 10 Blog entry</h3>

<p>
    This week I worked on login and aunthentication module. I developed successfully the login, sign up and the register pages.
    I started off from the templates prepared in previous week and applied passport authentication on node.js on them.
    This week was very good learning experience for me as I learned new ways to authenticate and store cookies.
