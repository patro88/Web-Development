<h3>Week 2 Blog entry</h3>

<p>
    This week I worked on the Bootstrap CSS. This is a very powerful framework which helps to render many CSS elements.
    Bootstrap has global CSS settings. The fundamental HTML elements are styled and enhanced with extensible classes.
    It also has an advanced grid system.

    Following is a list of Experiments I performed while exploring the Bootstrap framework. <br />

    <a href="../experiments/week02/week202.htm" target="_blank"> Bootstrap Tables </a> <br />
    <a href="../experiments/week02/week203.htm" target="_blank"> Bootstrap Forms </a><br />
    <a href="../experiments/week02/week204.htm" target="_blank"> Bootstrap Buttons </a><br />
    <a href="../experiments/week02/week205.htm" target="_blank"> Bootstrap Helper classes </a>
</p>

    I have learned to exploit the CSS functionalities of Bootstrap. It will be very useful in decorating my web pages 
    and making them standard across all devices.
