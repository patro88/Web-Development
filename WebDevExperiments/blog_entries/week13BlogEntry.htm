<h3>Week 13 Blog entry</h3>

<p>
    This week on my ongoing project I decided to change my homepage and add question and answers API.
    This API will contain following pages in total
   I <ul>
        <li>Ask a question</li>
        <li>View all Questions</li>
        <li>View a Question</li>
        <li>Tag</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br /><br />

<p>
    I am unable to figure out how to implement the tags functionality.
    I will be wiorking on it along with other functionalities.
    Also I have a problem in my widget screen where I need to save an image to the database.
