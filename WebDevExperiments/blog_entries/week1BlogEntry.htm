<h3>Week 1 Blog entry</h3>

<p>
    This week I started working on Web development with home page customization.
    I did some HTML and CSS experiments and completed the home page modifications.

<p>
    I started off with basic form elements in HTML and some new HTML5 elements. <br />

</p>

    After that I did some interesting application in HTML like media tags,
    plugins inside HTML and HTML APIs. in addition to HTML , I did basic CSS implementation, CSS animations (transition, transformation) and multiple columns in css.

    I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS in the starting week of the course. I hope to learn more exciting technologies in the coming weeks.
